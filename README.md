Deep Neural Network-based Retinal Disease Classifier using OCT Scans
Implemented a CNN with six convolutional blocks in PyTorch to classify Diabetic Macular Edema (DME),
Choroidal NeoVascularization (CNV), and drusen from OCT images. Achieved over 99% training accuracy
and 96.30% testing accuracy on around 83,484 images. Utilized Grad-CAM for disease region visualization,
with the model using only 6.9% of the parameters of ResNet-50, making it suitable for real-time applications.
